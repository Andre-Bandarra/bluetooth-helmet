## Description

I've wanted to improve the communication quality and ease with Gemma in flight so I designed and installed a smooth tangle-free bluetooth system on our new helmets. The result is instant 2 way communication, all hands free! Works really well and tested up to 1Km away but probably would work even further. Also no wind noise what so ever, pretty cool.
